# Samsara Take-home assessment

## Overview 
I wanted to use the VueJS framework, which I currently use at North Face, and continuing to learn, so I set up a [vue cli hello world boiler plate](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/creating-a-project.html#vue-create)
using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) locally on my computer, ingesting the data.json file and figured out how to create a specific component to handle the data, then followed the [documentation](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html) on how to make it work with Github Pages while also running into some issues displaying. Please let me know if this does not load. 

Planning on coming back and putting more information into this to go into detail for each part.
